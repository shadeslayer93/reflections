What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
-	When we initialize a repository, a .git folder is created, which stores the metadata, regarding this repository. To track the history of the file contents in this repository , it is important to first convert it, into a Git repository, for which the init command is used. To initalize a folder into a Git repository, "git init" is used, in that folder. After that the status of the repository can be found out using the "git status" command.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
-	The staging area contains those files from the working directory, that you want to clump together in one commit. Files are added to the staging area from the working directory using the "git add <file-name>" . In this way, instead of adding all, files and committing them each time, we can commit only those files in which a logical change is occuring.
